  <h1> How I Went From Dealing With Karen's To Educating Our Youth </h1>
  <h3> Written By: Katie Himes</h3>
  <p> In 2019 I was a lost college kid who had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I was working several jobs in the restaurant and retail industries and was miserable. 
		<br> I <i>hated</i> my life, I realized that I <b>needed</b> to make a change.
	<br>One day while on a break at my mundane job I did a quick Google search and looked for entry-level positions near me.
	<br> This led me to find a job titled Casa-Aid.
Casa is a program in Loudoun County that provides daycare services for elementary-aged children from 2 to 6 p.m. after school hours.
<br>I had never worked directly with kids before however, I was desperate to find something new and something that had a purpose.
Once I started this job and worked with these students I discovered the joys of teaching and the passion that I wanted to pursue.
<br>It was challenging but that's what I like the most about it.
I realized then that my passion was working with children and teaching. There is a joy in teaching that I wish everybody could experience at least once in their lifetime.
<br> I found patience that I did not realize that I had before and something that motivated me to become a better person. It did not stop there eventually I outgrew Casa and realized it was time to move on. 
<br>The new opportunity presented itself when I discovered that I was eligible to become a substitute teacher. From this point, I began working in public schools and I worked with all ages. 
<br>Embarking on this journey was not an easy one it came with many hard days and many challenging days. That is what I enjoy most about teaching though no days are the same. for the past three years, I have been working in Loudoun County Public Schools in many different roles.
<br> I began working as a substitute teacher and rose in the ranks to make my way into a full-time position right around the time that Covid-19 impacted the world. The way the education industry has changed has been significant throughout these past couple of years. 
<br>I was teaching kids online and could not see their faces but they can see mine. I often worried about them and hoped that at least if they saw me for an hour or two hours a day then maybe I could provide them with a safe space in a time of mass uncertainty.  
<br>Eventually, I worked my way into a more permanent position working with children and a credit recovery program. 
<br>This presented new challenges because these children had not been in school in over a year and were failing most of their classes. Managing several of these students I'm getting back onto a normal schedule presented its challenges and I had many tough days. 
<br>But I saw a light at the end of the tunnel one day when a girl I was working with told me that I saved her life. 
<br>She was overwhelmed with work and adjusting back to school which were all things that I could relate to because I was a college student at the time going through the same thing.
<br> I don't believe that I can change the world but I believe I can make an impact locally and give back to my community. That is what drew me to teach. I hope the desired field I would like to go into is public education.
<br> For the past few years, I have worked within the school system. Subsequently, I have seen many changes in the system following Covid-19.
<br>While there are many frustrations you will encounter when being involved with education, I believe taking that jump to try it would not hurt anyone.
<br>You never want to think, 'what if'. I am glad I got out of my comfort zone, it has helped me grow substantially.</p>
